<h1><b>Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews</b></h1>
<p>In this project, I have implemented the conecept of Sentiment Analysis to analyze product reviews of some products from online stores and used them to determine the sentiment of the user like for example if they liked the specific product or not based on a count of positive and negative words used in the product review.</p>
<p>To get started download the SFrame used by this project from here: https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/y4OKQuIFEemJfgqR2HI2sA_43be9d356abf4561888105f8045995bf_amazon_baby.sframe.zip?Expires=1648339200&Signature=JBH3~lxwz2z4wq9EwGj4LNOHyamhlF-aquaiAZEFmXm4hqpIjZCHQceEA2Os-Hced8eiEyvpYncqi3RoSeMPceBh6kSSKHx0ze9RPZb91rwGe2azn7BUhiFfQ4xqRSU56TXRgmHwVhRUHQjjftN-n8Yl3yPzvRicuhnsJ8KTO6E_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A.</p>
<p>Unzip the folder obtained from the link and look for the file called as <b>m_bfaa91c17752f745.0000</b>.Then move this file to the folder amazon_baby.sframe that is present in the <b>same folder as this README.md file.</b></p>
